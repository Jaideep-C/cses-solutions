# CSES Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the problems on the [CSES](https://cses.fi/problemset/) website. All the solutions are written in C++ and are organized by task number.

## Getting Started

To use these solutions, simply download or clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/cses-solutions.git
```

Then, navigate to the task directory and compile the C++ file:

```bash
cd cses-solutions
g++ -o {task_number} {task_number}.cpp
```
Finally, run the executable file:

```bash
./{task_number}
```


## Contributing

If you have a better solution or found a bug in one of my solutions, feel free to contribute by creating a pull request. I would appreciate any feedback or suggestions to improve the code.

## Acknowledgments
